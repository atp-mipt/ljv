LJV is tool for visualizing Java data structures, using [Graphviz](http://graphviz.gitlab.io/).

It was developed by John Hamer in 2004 and released under GNU GPL (see the [original project page](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~j-hamer/LJV.html)).

This project aims to upgrade this tool to modern Java and make it an open source library in the modern sense of the word.
